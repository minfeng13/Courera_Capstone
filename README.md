<h3>Comparing boroughs of London using K-means clustering</h3>
<p><h5><b>Introduction:</b> I did my undergraduate degree in London and it was one of the best times of my life. I spent most of my time living at the same post code (in Bloomsbury), but am considering moving to another borough. In this project, I will be using Foursquare API to compare different borough and determine how similar or dissimilar they are to Bloomsbury.</h5></p>
